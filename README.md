# ðŸ«€ Predicting Heart Disease with KNeighborsClassifier

This project demonstrates how to use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health metrics. It is a hands-on implementation for understanding how machine learning can assist in early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Accurate and early prediction can be lifesaving. In this notebook, we:

- Explore and clean a medical dataset.
- Perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Scale the features for optimal KNN performance.
- Train and evaluate a **KNeighborsClassifier**.
- Visualize performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Library**: `scikit-learn`
- **Scaler**: `StandardScaler` for feature normalization

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels (0-3)
- Thalassemia type
- **Target** (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- Feature scaling significantly improved model performance.
- Optimal K value selection is crucial for KNN to perform well.
- Visualization of confusion matrix and classification metrics helped assess class-level performance.
